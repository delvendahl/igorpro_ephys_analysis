### üí° ABOUT
This repository contains IgorPro code to analyse voltage-clamp and current-clamp data acquired using HEKA Patchmaster software. The two folders contain .ipf files with code and documentation for analysing voltage-clamp step protocols and current-clamp current injection protocols.


### üíª INSTALLATION
Analysis code was developed and tested in IgorPro 6.37 running on Mac OS 10.14.6.

To use the code, you need to install IgorPro (by [WaveMetrics](https://www.wavemetrics.com)). Open and compile the respective .ipf file to use the analysis code. The main functions can be called from the Menu "Macros". 

To import HEKA .dat files, Patcher's Power Tools are required: [PPT](http://www3.mpibpc.mpg.de/groups/neher/index.php?page=software)
